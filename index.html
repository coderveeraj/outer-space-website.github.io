<img src="cosnotyourG.jpg" alt="cosmology">
      <p>Cosmology is the study of the origin, evolution, and ultimate fate of the universe. It is a branch of astronomy that uses mathematics and physical laws to understand and explain the properties and behavior of the universe on the largest scales. Some of the major questions that cosmologists try to answer include: How did the universe begin? How has it evolved over time? What is the structure of the universe? What is the ultimate fate of the universe?</p>
